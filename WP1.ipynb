The model allows the firm’s manager to potentially **misperceive** the market prices of long- and short-term risk, leading to suboptimal decisions.\n","\n","We distinguish between:\n","\n","- **$w(c)$**: the **manager’s perceived scaled firm value**, used to compute the optimal investment policy $l(c)$\n","- **$v(c)$**: the **true scaled firm value**, conditional on the firm following investment policy $l(c)$ derived from $w(c)$\n","\n","Here, $c = M / A$ is the firm’s cash-to-asset ratio.\n","\n","\n","### 1. Economic Derivation of the Coupled ODE System\n","\n","The system stems from the firm’s intertemporal optimization problem under uncertainty and adjustment costs. Letting $V(a, m)$ denote firm value as a function of assets $a$ and cash $m$, the Bellman equation implies:\n","\n","$$\n","r V = \\text{(expected change in value)}\n","$$\n","\n","Exploiting scale invariance, the problem reduces to one state: the cash-to-asset ratio $c = m / a$. We define the **scaled value function** $v(c)$ such that $V(a, m) = a \\cdot v(c)$. Because of stochastic shocks, the HJB equation becomes a **second-order nonlinear ODE** in $v(c)$. The optimal investment policy $l(c)$ solves a first-order condition that links marginal and average value:\n","\n","$$\n","l(c) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\left( \\frac{v(c)}{v'(c)} - (1 + c) \\right)\n","$$\n","\n","If the firm **misperceives** the term structure of risk (i.e., uses incorrect prices of long- and short-term risk), it forms expectations based on a distorted value function $w(c)$. The policy $l(c)$ is then computed from $w(c)$, while the true value $v(c)$ still evolves under that same $l(c)$. This leads to a **coupled ODE system**: one equation for $w(c)$ (subjective beliefs), one for $v(c)$ (true valuation), both tied by the same policy rule $l(c)$.\n","\n","\n","### 2.
